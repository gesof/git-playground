      <h3>Is taxation theft?</h3>
      <p>If I came to your house with some heavily armed buddies, demanded that you and your neighbors give me a percentage of your income, in return for some crappy monopolized services that you didn't ask for, would you consider that theft?</p>

      <h3>So, what you're saying is...?</h3>
      <p>Libertarians want to live in a world where gay couples can protect their poppy fields with fully automatic weapons. <br />
      A world where voluntaryism and property rights are treated with the highest respect.
